# 100 Days Of Code - Log

# Day 1: January 2, 2017
First project. I want a way to keep track of my albums, so that I don't re-purchase any of them. I want to start with simple CRUD and eventually add in a couple of features:

* It should offer a web extension so that anytime I was on Amazon, it would alert me if I already had the album.
* It should have a timeline view so that I can view my albums by year.
